	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is my gomoku website&#127918. And this is definitely not a perfect website for playing gomoku online.</br>
	This  website was originally developed for playing within my friends, which means a small community. As a result I didn't develop multiroom system. Which means this website can only let exactly two player playing. So if you go online and find out there are already peopl playing, you can be a spectater.
	</br>
	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere's no system monitering the current players. So as a player or a spectater, you can click the board to take over your opponent's turn, but please don't do this since it interrupts others playing experience. The reason that I didn't build this monitering system is because it can let player who has a higher techniques teaches his/her opponent when they are playing through a phone talk. In order to teach, sometimes one needs to take over his opponent's role.

	&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEnjoy yourself!&#128516&#128516&#128516
